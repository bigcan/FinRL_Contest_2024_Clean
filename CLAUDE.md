# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is the FinRL Contest 2024 repository for the ACM ICAIF 2024 competition, featuring two main tasks:
- **Task 1**: Cryptocurrency Trading with Ensemble Learning (Bitcoin LOB data)
- **Task 2**: LLM-Engineered Signals with Reinforcement Learning from Market Feedback (RLMF)

## Development Principles

- No mock models or fallback plans or shortcuts unless explicitly approved by the user
- **IMPORTANT**: Update README.md files after each development phase to maintain accurate documentation
  - Update main project README with major changes
  - Update task-specific READMEs with implementation details
  - Document critical bug fixes, new features, and architectural changes
  - Include update logs with dates at the top of README files
- When you create a temporary solution to fix an issue, don't forget to go back to original plan

## Commands

### Task 1: Cryptocurrency Trading

**CURRENT WORKING COMMANDS (Updated 2025-07-29):**

#### Option 1: Original Framework (100% Reliable)
```bash
cd development/task1
# Train ensemble models
python src/task1_ensemble.py

# Evaluate trained models  
python src/task1_eval.py

# Verify existing models
python training_verification_test.py
```

#### Option 2: Refactored Framework (83% Working, 25% Faster)
```bash
cd development/task1
# First validate framework
python run_refactored_validation.py

# If 5/6 tests pass, use refactored training
python src_refactored/train_enhanced_ensemble.py
```

#### Quick Reference
```bash
# For contest use, follow this guide:
cat CONTEST_USAGE.md

# Check validated models:
ls complete_production_results/production_models/
```

### Task 2: LLM-based Signal Generation
```bash
# Train LLM with RLMF
python task2_train.py

# Evaluate fine-tuned model
python task2_eval.py

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Current Project Status (Updated 2025-07-29)

### Task 1: Production Ready ✅
**Validated Models Available:**
- `complete_production_results/production_models/` contains 3 verified models
- All models pass integrity checks (no NaN/Inf, proper loading)
- Training verification results available in `training_verification_results.json`

**Framework Status:**
- **Original Framework**: 100% working, reliable for production
- **Refactored Framework**: 83% working (5/6 tests pass), 25% performance improvement
- **Fallback Systems**: Implemented for graceful degradation

**Recent Critical Fixes (2025-07-29):**
- ✅ Fixed refactored framework import issues (relative imports → fallbacks)
- ✅ Resolved tensor dimension mismatches in evaluation pipeline  
- ✅ Added comprehensive model validation system
- ✅ Archived experimental code to reduce complexity
- ✅ Created contest usage documentation

**Known Issues:**
- Occasional tensor dimension errors during training evaluation phase
- Some import warnings in refactored framework (non-blocking, fallbacks work)
- Complex codebase due to multiple experimental approaches (organized via documentation)

### Task 2: Status Unknown
- Commands listed above are placeholder
- Requires separate assessment

## Important Context for AI Assistants

### What Works Reliably
1. **Original training framework** (`python src/task1_ensemble.py`)
2. **Model validation system** (`python training_verification_test.py`)
3. **Validated production models** in `complete_production_results/`

### What's Experimental/In-Progress
1. **Refactored framework** - mostly working but has fallbacks
2. **GPU scripts** in `archive_experiments/` - archived experimental code
3. **Various training approaches** - multiple attempts archived

### Contest Strategy
- **Primary**: Use original framework for reliability
- **Secondary**: Use refactored framework when performance boost needed
- **Fallback**: Validated models always available for immediate use
- **Documentation**: Follow `CONTEST_USAGE.md` for quick reference

### Maintenance Philosophy
- **Contest-first approach**: Winning > clean code during contest
- **Working solutions preserved**: Don't break what works
- **Documentation updated**: Reflects current working state
- **Post-contest cleanup planned**: Major refactoring after contest

### Commands to Remember
```bash
# Quick status check
python training_verification_test.py

# Validate refactored framework  
python run_refactored_validation.py

# Contest quick reference
cat CONTEST_USAGE.md

# Find working models
ls complete_production_results/production_models/
```
