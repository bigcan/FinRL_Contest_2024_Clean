| Evaluator:
| `step`: Number of samples, or total training steps, or running times of `env.step()`.
| `time`: Time spent from the start of training to this moment.
| `avgR`: Average value of cumulative rewards, which is the sum of rewards in an episode.
| `stdR`: Standard dev of cumulative rewards, which is the sum of rewards in an episode.
| `avgS`: Average of steps in an episode.
| `objC`: Objective of Critic network. Or call it loss function of critic network.
| `objA`: Objective of Actor network. It is the average Q value of the critic network.
