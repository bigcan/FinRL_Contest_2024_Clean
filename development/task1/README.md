## 💻 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### For Contest Training (Updated Multi-Episode Process)
1. **Validate configuration** with `python validate_train_val_split.py`
2. **Start multi-episode training** with `python src/task1_ensemble.py`
3. **Monitor 65-episode progress** with real-time logging and plots
4. **Evaluate on holdout data** with `python src/task1_eval.py`
5. **Fallback plan**: Use existing validated models from `complete_production_results/`

### For Performance Optimization
1. **Validate refactored framework**: `python run_refactored_validation.py`
2. **If 5/6 tests pass**: Use refactored framework for 25% speed boost
3. **If validation fails**: Stick with original framework

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Tensor dimension errors**: Often resolved by restarting training
2. **GPU memory issues**: Adjust batch size or use CPU fallback
3. **Import errors**: Use fallback implementations (already configured)

### Quick Fixes
- **Model loading fails**: Use models from `complete_production_results/`
- **Training crashes**: Check `direct_training.log` for tensor errors
- **Framework confusion**: Follow `CONTEST_USAGE.md` exactly
