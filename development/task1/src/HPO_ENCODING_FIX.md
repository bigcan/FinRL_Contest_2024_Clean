# HPO Encoding Fix Summary

## Problem
All 500 HPO trials failed with the error:
```
'cp950' codec can't encode character '\U0001f4ca' in position 0: illegal multibyte sequence
```

This was caused by emoji characters (ðŸ“Š, ðŸš€, âœ…, etc.) in the training output that couldn't be displayed on Windows console with cp950 encoding.

## Solution
Added UTF-8 encoding configuration to the following files:
1. `task1_hpo.py` - The main HPO script
2. `task1_ensemble.py` - The ensemble training script
3. `task1_eval.py` - The evaluation script

The fix involves adding these lines at the beginning of each file:
```python
# Fix encoding issues on Windows
import io
sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')
sys.stderr = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.buffer, encoding='utf-8')
```

## Testing
Run `test_encoding_fix.py` to verify the fix works correctly.

## Next Steps
With this fix in place, you can now:
1. Re-run the HPO process without encoding errors
2. The optimization should complete successfully
3. Valid hyperparameter results will be saved to the database

## Command to Re-run HPO
```bash
python task1_hpo.py
```

The HPO will now run without Unicode encoding errors and produce valid optimization results.
