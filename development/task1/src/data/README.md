Required files:
1. **BTC_1sec.csv** - 1 second level LOB (Limit Order Book) Bitcoin data
2. **BTC_1sec_predict.npy** - Strong RNN factors generated on the CSV dataset to train the DRL agent

Please download these files and place them in this `data/` directory before running the training scripts.

## Data Description
- The RNN features were generated by training an RNN model on 60% of the dataset
- The RNN predicts future price movements using 101 formulaic alphas
- These strong factors are used as technical factors to train the FinRL agent
- The timestamps in the dataset have been processed and are not the true timestamps
