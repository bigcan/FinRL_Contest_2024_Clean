# Cleanup Summary - FinRL Contest 2024

## Cleanup Operations Completed

### 1. ✅ Python Cache Cleanup
- Removed all `.pyc` files
- Deleted all `__pycache__` directories
- **Space saved**: ~1.2MB

### 2. ✅ Fixed Requirements File
- Removed UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)
- Fixed CRLF line endings to LF
- File is now properly formatted

### 3. ✅ Archived Logs and Experiments
Created archive structure:
```
archived_experiments/
├── logs/           # All .log files moved here
├── hpo_databases/  # HPO database files (task1_hpo.db, task1_production_hpo.db)
└── old_models/     # Old training runs and test models
```

Archived items:
- All log files from HPO experiments
- HPO database files (contains failed optimization history)
- Old model directories:
  - `ensemble_extended_phase1_*` directories
  - `test_models/`
  - `test_ultimate_models/`

### 4. ✅ Model Consolidation
Kept only the most recent/important models:
- `ensemble_optimized_phase2/` - Latest optimized ensemble
- `production_training_results/` - Production training outputs

### Space Savings Summary
- Python cache: 1.2MB
- Archived logs: ~2-3MB
- Archived models: ~10MB
- **Total space cleaned**: ~13-15MB

### What's Left
Active/important directories preserved:
- `ensemble_optimized_phase2/` - Current best models
- `production_training_results/` - Recent training results
- `hpo_experiments/` - HPO configuration and results
- Source code files - All intact

### Next Steps
1. The HPO can now be re-run with the encoding fix
2. Old experiments are safely archived if needed for reference
3. Working directory is clean and organized

## Archive Location
All archived files are in: `./archived_experiments/`

You can safely delete this directory if you don't need the historical data.
